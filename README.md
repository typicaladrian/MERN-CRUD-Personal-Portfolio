# Adrian Rodriguez's Personal Porfolio Website
**Deployed using Render, can be accessed 24/7 at https://typicaladrian.com.**

Developed a dynamic and responsive personal portfolio website using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements. The website includes an interactive project gallery, and a resume section. Integrated backend API for seamless project data management. Designed with a focus on user experience, accessibility, and modern web design principles. Highlights my Bachelor's of Computer Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, relevant experience, and skills in full-stack development, including proficiency in JavaScript, React, and RESTful APIs. Deployed the website on Render for real-world accessibility.
